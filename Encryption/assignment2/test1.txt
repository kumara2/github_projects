This paper builds a protocol using the building blocks we have discussed so far 
. Implement a version of their protocol ( the more features in the protocol the 
better ) .  Also , create a guide on how to use your code .  The guide should 
include a walk through of all of the features of your software .  You should 
also turn in the supporting files so that the walk through could be duplicated .
