To make pulp from wood , a chemical pulping process separates lignin from cellulose
fibers . This is accomplished by dissolving lignin in a cooking liquor , so that it
may be washed from the cellulose fibers. This preserves the length of the cellulose
 fibers. Paper made from chemical pulps are also known as wood-free papers–not to 
be confused with tree-free paper. This is because they do not contain lignin , which
deteriorates over time. The pulp can also be bleached to produce white paper, but 
this consumes 5% of the fibers. Chemical pulping processes are not used to make 
paper made from cotton , which is already 90% cellulose .
