/**
   \brief A simple note generator that converts standard Western Music
   notes "CDEFGAB" at different Octaves (0 through 6) and Tempos (32
   through 255).

   <p>This method converts a valid note string representations to
   corresponding numerical note values in the range 0-84 based on the
   current octave.  Valid note string representations are in the form
   <tt>A-G[#,+,-][Length][.]</tt> where \c A through \c G are notes. A
   \c # or \c + character following a note produces a sharp or the
   next higher note while \c - after a note produces a flat. Examples
   of valid notes includes: A B E3 C# C#2..</p>

   <p>If an optional numeric length value is specified after the note,
   then the specified length value is used instead of the default note
   length set for the score.</p>
   
   <p>A period (\c .) after a note increases the playing time of the
   note by 3/2 times the period determined by length of note times the
   tempo.  Multiple periods can appear after a note, and the playing
   time is scaled accordingly. For example, \c A. will cause the note
   \c A to play one and half times the playing time determined by
   length of the note times the tempo.  Similarly, two periods placed
   after A (\c A..)  will cause the note to be played at 9/4 times its
   ascribed value; an \c A with three periods (\c A...) at 27/8, and
   so on.</p>

   In addition to the notes this class also handles the following
   meta notes:

   <ul>

   <li> <b>L#</b> (where \c # is an integer in the range 1 through 32):
   Changes the default length of notes. Example: \c L1 (full length
   notes), \c L2 (1/2 length notes), \c L4 (1/4 length notes)
   etc.</li>

   <li> <b>O#</b> (where \c # is an integer in the range 1 through 6):
   Changes the default octave (or frequency) for the notes.  Example:
   \c O1 (low frequency), \c O6 (high frequency).</li>

   <li> <b>T#</b> (where \c # is an integer in the range 32 through
   254): Changes the default tempo (or duration) for the notes.
   Example: \c T64 (notes are long), \c T200 (short notes).</li>

   <li> <b>T#</b> (where \c # is an integer in the range 1 through
   32): Introduces a pause (or silent note, with amplitude zero) for
   the given note length.</li>

   <li> <b>V#</b> (where \c # is an integer in the range 1 through
   20000): Changes the volume (or peak amplitude) of a given
   note.</li>

   <li> <b> \< </b>: Decreases the current octave by one.</li>

   <li> <b> \< </b>: Increases the current octave by one.</li>   

   </ul>

   Here is the music notes associated with the nursery rhyme "mary had
   a little lamb":

   \code

   b a g a b b b2
   a a a2 b b b2 b a g a b b b b
   a a b a g1

       generated per minute which means that each quarter note is 1

        at a given tempo.  The length value can be in the range 1 to

        (that corresponds to various note lengths) the actual time (in

        The Octave essentially determines the frequency or pitch of

        The default Octave value is 4.  A zero octave value
        corresponds to zero frequency (or pure silence). Higher octave
        values indicate higher frequency or high pitch.  Each octave
        consists of the following 12 notes: {C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#,
        G, G#, A, A#, B}.  In a given octave, each of these 12 notes
        are assigned consecutive numbers in the range 0 to 11 (similar
        to index values in an array).  Furthermore, given 1 through 6
        octaves (each octave having 12 notes), the total number of
        notes this class must handle is 7 * 12 = 84 notes.  The
        frequencies corresponding to each of the 84 notes (or keys on
        a piano) can be computed using the formula:

        freq = 440 * exp(log(2) * (note - 46) / 12)

        to piano keyboards is available at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_key_frequencies
